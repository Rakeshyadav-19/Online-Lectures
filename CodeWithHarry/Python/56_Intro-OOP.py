'''
OOP - 

classes and objects

encapsulation - means that the internal state of an object is hidden and can only be accessed or modified through the object's methods. This helps to protect the object's data and prevent it from being modified in unexpected ways

inheritance - allows new classes to be created that inherit the properties and methods of an existing class. This allows for code reuse and makes it easy to create new classes that have similar functionality to existing classes

Polymorphism - objects of different classes can be treated as if they were objects of a common class. This allows for greater flexibility in code and makes it easier to write code that can work with multiple types of objects.

def hello():
  print("hello")

hello()
sales1 = 6000
profit1 = 2000
ad1 = 1000
# rajeev.sales

sales2 = 6000
profit2 = 2000
ad2 = 1000 
# vikrant.sales

# Instead of writng code for 100 sales write a class and object
 
# RailwayForm   ---> Class [blueprint]
# harry --> harry ki info wala form --> Object [entity]
# tom --> tom ki info wala form --> Object [entity]
# shubham -- shubham ki info wala form --> Object [entity]

# shubham.changeName("Shubhi")
